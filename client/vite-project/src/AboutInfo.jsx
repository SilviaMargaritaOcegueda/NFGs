                            The project is to create a mega-leaderboard that aggregates scores of each Tennis Player in this Season. Depending on the number of games you‚Äôve played and the performance in each of those games, players will get rewarded with specials ranks and NFTs badges. A tournament will start when all the games have shown up and will last a week. This will be the time to show the world your player's skills.

                            Scores are normalized among trainings/tournaments hosted on each season; it means that each tournament and training match will have as much impact on your leaderboard score as the others.
